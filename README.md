Description of all files:

DSACircularQueue.java - My implementation of a queue.

DSAGraph.java - My implementation of a graph.

DSAGraphVertex.java - This class is used by the DSAGraph class to implement graph vertices.

DSAHashTable.java - My implementation of a hash table.

DSAHeap.java - My implementation of a heap.

DSAHeapEntry.java - This class is used by the DSAHeap class to implement the heap entries.

GraphLinkedList.java - This is a linked list implementation specifically tailored for the graphs,
                       so I can access the individual graph vertices in the linked list.

GraphStack.java - This is a stack implementation specifically made for the graphs. Its primary use
                  is in graph traversal.

HashTableLinkedList.java - This is a linked list implementation made for the hash table (not like
                           GraphLinkedList.java). The difference is that it stores Shop objects,
                           instead of graph vertices.

Shop.java - This class is used to implement Shop objects

ShopStack.java - This is a stack implementation specifically made for storing Shop objects.

Menu.java - This is the main interface for running the program. Run it using the command:
            'java Menu'


How to run the program?

To run the program:

1) Open the terminal and type: javac *.java
2) Still on the terminal, type: java Menu

Once you finish Step 2, the program will start. The first thing shown is the help menu.
If there is a need to print this help menu again, simply type 'help' in the program.
