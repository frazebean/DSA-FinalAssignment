There will be 6 test datas used:

After inputting these test data, the graph should be made like this:

1 -> 2, 4, 5, 6
2 -> 1, 4
3 -> 4
4 -> 1, 2, 3
5 -> 1, 6
6 -> 1, 5

(This can be achieved by adding pathways between shops, which is operation 4).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After testing the BFS and DFS traversal, the hash table can be tested by choosing operation 7 (search by category).
This operation will prompt for a category to enter. All 6 test data supplied are evenly split
between the 'Clothing' and 'Electronics' categories. This should allow for testing the hash
table adequately. Should a user enter a non-existent category (in this context, any input
that is not 'Clothing' or 'Electronics'), the program will say it does not exist.

When operation 7 is chosen and a valid category is chosen, the hash table is automatically displayed
in this order:

Number, Name, Location, Rating

To test the shops rating, operation 7 will also ask if the user wants to sort the category by ratings.
Sorting the category by ratings displays data like this:

Rating, Number, Name, Location

The reason the order is changed if the user chooses to sort by rating is so that users can
immediately see ratings.
